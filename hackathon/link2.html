            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Stay active</span>: Regular physical activity can help reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Eat Well</span>: a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can support brain health and mood regulation.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Get enough sleep</span>: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can negatively impact mood and cognitive function.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Manage Stress</span>:  Practice stress management techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and promote relaxation.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Stay connected</span>: Maintain social connections with friends, family, and community members. Social support can provide emotional resilience during challenging times.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Set boundaries</span>: Learn to say no to activities or commitments that overwhelm you. Setting boundaries can help prevent burnout and maintain balance in your life.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Seek help when needed</span>: Don't hesitate to reach out for professional help if you're struggling with your mental health. Therapists, counselors, or support groups can provide valuable support and guidance.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Limit alcohol and avoid drugs</span>: Excessive alcohol consumption and drug use can worsen mental health issues and interfere with treatment effectiveness. Limit your intake or avoid them altogether.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Pratice self care</span>:  Make time for activities you enjoy and prioritize self-care. Engage in hobbies, relaxation techniques, or creative outlets to nurture your well-being.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Stay informed</span>: Educate yourself about mental health conditions and resources available for support. Knowledge empowers you to recognize symptoms, seek help, and advocate for yourself or others.</li>
            <p id="last" style="font-weight: 600;">Remember that maintaining good mental health is an ongoing process that requires self-awareness, self-care, and sometimes professional support. Prioritize your mental well-being just as you would your physical health.</p>
